Description:
Using the logical Binary heap data structure, this program gives each node a third child. The console displays an array
initialized with assigned values then displays the heap as each number is pushed on sequentially from left to right. It then 
removes each evalue in the array and displays the new form of the heap and displays the heap as an array.

How to use:
To use the program, simply run and view the output in the console.
