Description:
Logically applying a circular queue data structure with arrays, this program emulates the line at a cash register and customer interactons with
those lines. The console will display the current state of the line and append either "F" or "B" to the customer's number to
indicate whether they are in the front or the back of the line.

How to use:
After compiling and running the program, the console will display the current state of the queue. Input "E" to add a customer
to the shortest line. Input either the numbers 1, 2, and 3 to remove a customer from a queue. Inputing "F" is to fill every queue with customers.
Inputing "C" clears each queue of all their customers. While, inputing "Q" quits and ends the program.
