Description:
This program takes a text file "CountrySortedAlpha.txt" and random unsorts into "CountryUnsortedAlpha.txt", and sorts by descending country
population. Additionally, it forms a hash table, allows the user to search for countries, and outputs the country and preceding countries in the
cluster if necessary.

Dependencies:
The program depends on having the "CountrySortedAlpha.txt" with the country information formatted similarly as the one in the respository. Also,
both text files need to be within the same directory as the program.

How to use:
Run the program and the console will prompt the user to search for countries. The text file "CountryUnsortedAlpha.txt" will be populated
with the unsorted list.
