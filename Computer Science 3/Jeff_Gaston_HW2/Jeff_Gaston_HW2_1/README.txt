Description:
This program outputs a String for the current time digtally formatted and outputted to the console.

How to use:
To use the program, compile and run it.

Problem solving approach:
My provlem solving approach for this problem was to make the category for output and then break it down from the information that I didn't have. I approached
the output as a matrix but had each individual number as a line of the matrix. For example, the output was 19x2 values based on the size of the outputs. In order
to compensate for the differeing sizes of the outputs, I counted each output as an individual line of output which condensed it to a matrix of 5x7. Five digits
of output across and 7 digits tall. From there I made seperate methods to print out each digit 0-9 and one for the colon. Then I utilizied the main class to print
out  the time with the new digital digits by using a for loop to run through the matrix.
